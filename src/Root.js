// This example has 3 pages: a public page, a protected
// page, and a login screen. In order to see the protected
// page, you must first login. Pretty standard stuff.
//
// First, visit the public page. Then, visit the protected
// page. You're not yet logged in, so you are redirected
// to the login page. After you login, you are redirected
// back to the protected page.
//
// Notice the URL change each time. If you click the back
// button at this point, would you expect to go back to the
// login page? No! You're already logged in. Try it out,
// and you'll see you go back to the page you visited
// just *before* logging in, the public page.
